# Purpose
Automatically export PlusPortals upcoming coursework to ToDoList (todoist.com), which the site itself has features for 2 way sync with Google calendar and. 1 way sync wih Apple calendar.

# Workings
With your login info on plusportals, and api token for todoist, sync is possible to achieve, with requests happening on a given interval, 10 minutes a good intervals since teachers barely use plusportals anyways. However, at the moment you have to manually retrieve a _requestVerificationToken value for the get API request to work_. This problem will be attempted to be fixed in the upcoming school year. 

**the reason i made this thing public is to serve as a reminder for myself in the future to fix**
